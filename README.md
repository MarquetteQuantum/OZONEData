# Ozone_Database
This database includes:
1) "Normal" ozone without substitution of rare isotopes 16O16O16O;
2) Symmetric 16O18O16O and asymmetric 16O16O18O ozone molecules with single substitution of more abundant heavy isotope 18O;
3) Symmetric 18O16O18O and asymmetric 16O18O18O ozone molecules with double substitutions of more abundant heavy isotope 18O;
4) Symmetric 16O17O16O and asymmetric 16O16O17O ozone molecules with single substitution of a rare heavy isotope 17O;
5) The heaviest ozone 18O18O18O that includes three 18O isotopes.

For each rotational-vibrational state we reported its energy, width (inverse of lifetime for the metastable states above dissociation threshold), and rotational constants. Also, for each state we determined its character in terms of:
a) Probabilities in the covalently-bound deep well and in the weak-interaction van der Waals region of the potential energy susrface;
b) Its symmetry properties in terms of probabilities of symmetric and asymmetric isotopomers.

Also included are Matlab scripts for the processing of this database (not intended for external use at this time).
